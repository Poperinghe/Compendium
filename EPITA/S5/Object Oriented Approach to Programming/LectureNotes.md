Introspection: ability of a program to look at its own source code during run time.
Intercession: ability of a program to modify its own source code.
Construction of an object: Memory allocation + Initialization of values.

Derived attributes: their value is determined during construction based on the value of other attributes.

Constructors are not functions because they don't have a return value. Constructors are code segments that will be reused by the compiler when initializing new objects.

Methods cannot be redefined at runtime while regular attributes can.

free() <-- more research needed...
