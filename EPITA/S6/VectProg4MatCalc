python does not have an inbuilt array type
  -> we can use numpy's array type (which is equivalent to a real array)

the point of this class is going to be to solve problems efficiently using
matrixes. We will have to know by ourselves if our solution works or not (there
will not be a testsuite in the given files for the exam)

TDS will be mostly exercises
